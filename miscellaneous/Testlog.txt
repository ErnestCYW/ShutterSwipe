Current Bugs

v1.1:
    - NIL

v1.2:
    - NIL

v1.3:
    - JWT authentication may not be correct. Frontend routing causes login route to be accessed everytime when navigating page.
    - Feed displays same picture twice if multiple user likes / dislikes it, problem with get route in feed. (SOLVED)

v2.1:
    - tag_score does not take into account disliked photos
    - Ranking algorithmn has time complexity modelled after cumulative frequency graph / S shape graph; very bad complexity given large input. Can use SQL (Refactoring) to do faster but hard.
    - Values for A and B are not ideal, need to refine (SEE README Additional Notes Section)
    - Smooth refreshing problem, having to refresh and reload the page can be bad for user experience. Look into automated refreshers.
